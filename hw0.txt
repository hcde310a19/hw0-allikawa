# Description of your program (part 7)
First, create a scanner that can parse through strings and a variable to keep track of the amount of words scanned.
The scanner should start at the beginning of the document. The variable will start at 0.
Create a loop that can be used to make the scanner parse through the entire document.
The loop will continue as long as there is something next in the document.
For the first string encountered, the word count variable will increment by one.
Spaces will be used to separate groups of strings as words.

# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)
I thought the exercise was a little difficult since I had to think more complexly about what a program actually does.
Having to explain it in words made me realize how succinct programming is compared to plain English, and how much variety there is in written language.
While writing the description, I felt a bit frustrated since my explanation seemed too lengthy.
The words made sense in my head, but when I typed it down and looked at it I thought it might be confusing for someone else to read.

Some things I want to get out of this course:
- Become comfortable enough with Python that I can put it on my resume
- Understand how programming can be used to make more human-centered designs
- Create something I can put on my portfolio or talk about in interviews
